<!-- scope- determines what can see a variable -->
<!-- -global -->
<!-- local -->

<!-- a parent passes all its information down.
a child does not pass its information up
a child can see its parents but not vice versa
by up/ down we mean functions 
if you dont have a var JS will assume its global(dont do that)-->
<script type="text/javascript">
	function child(){

	var a = 2;
	console.log("a's value outside the function",a)
